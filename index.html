<h1>Adam's Notes</h1>
<b>How the Internet Works</b>
<p>The internet is a collection of computers that speak to each other. When one 
  goes to a webpage, his computer sends an <em>HTTP request to a server.</em>The 
  server then finds the requested HTML document and sends it back to the requestor. 
  The requestor's browser then interprets the page and displays it on the screen. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496"
  >This video</a> is a good reference for this topic.</p>
  <b>HTML</b>
  <p>HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language.</em> The web is a collection of HTML documents. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"
    >This video</a> explains further.</p>
  <b>Tags and Elements</b>
  <p>HTML documents are made up of HTML <b>elements</b>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers
    the type of element by using HTML <b>tags</b>. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444"
    >This video</a> does a good job of explaining.</p>
  <b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>  
  <p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.</p>
<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an invisible box around the content inside them.</p>
